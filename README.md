# Explosion Source Localization

This project aims to locate explosion sources using artificial intelligence models and advanced physical simulations. It is developed in collaboration with the **CEA (Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives)**.

## Project Description


The objective is to estimate the location of an explosion based on pressure data using several modeling approaches:
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
- **Random Forest**
- **Distance-Based Methods**

Each approach is detailed in the corresponding files within the repository.

## Physical Simulations

The physical simulations required for training and validating the models were conducted on the **CEA supercomputer**. These simulations leverage **parallel computing and optimization methods** to ensure high precision and maximum efficiency.
